## Machine Learning–Based Power Quality Analysis in Power Systems

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying power quality (PQ)
disturbances using machine learning and deep learning techniques.

### Power Quality Disturbances
- Harmonics
- Voltage sag
- Voltage swell
- Interruptions
- Flicker

### Methodology
- FFT-based frequency analysis
- Statistical feature extraction
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Machine learning models (RF, XGBoost, SVM)
- Deep learning models (ANN, LSTM)
- Model explainability using LIME

### Tools and Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Jupyter Notebook

### Applications
- Power quality monitoring
- Smart grids
- Power system protection
